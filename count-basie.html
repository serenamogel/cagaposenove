In 1958, Basie became the first African American male recipient of a Grammy Award. One of jazz music's all-time greats, he won many other Grammys throughout his career and worked with a plethora of artists, including Joe Williams and Ella Fitzgerald.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Basie was born William James Basie (with some sources listing his middle name as "Allen") on August 21, 1904, in Red Bank, New Jersey. His father Harvey was a mellophonist and his mother Lillian was a pianist who gave her son his first lessons. After moving to New York, he was further influenced by James P. Johnson and Fats Waller, with Waller teaching Basie organ-playing techniques.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Barons of Rhythm</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Basie played the vaudevillian circuit for a time until he got stuck in Kansas City, Missouri in the mid-1920s after his performance group disbanded. He went on to join Walter Page's Blue Devils in 1928, which he would see as a pivotal moment in his career, being introduced to the big-band sound for the first time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He later worked for a few years with a band led by Bennie Moten, who died in 1935. Basie then formed the Barons of Rhythm with some of his bandmates from Moten's group, including saxophonist Lester Young. With vocals by Jimmy Rushing, the band set up shop to perform at Kansas City's Reno Club.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Becomes 'Count'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During a radio broadcast of the band's performance, the announcer wanted to give Basie's name some pizazz, keeping in mind the existence of other bandleaders like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/duke-ellington data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Duke Ellington" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Duke Ellington</a> and Earl Hines. So he called the pianist "Count," with Basie not realizing just how much the name would catch on as a form of recognition and respect in the music world.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Hits That Swing</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Producer John Hammond heard the band's sound and helped secure further bookings. After some challenges, the Count Basie Orchestra had a slew of hits that helped to define the big-band sound of the 1930s and '40s. Some of their notable songs included "One O'Clock Jump"—the orchestra's signature tune which Basie composed himself — and "Jumpin' at the Woodside."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With the group becoming highly distinguished for its soloists, rhythm section and style of swing, Basie himself was noted for his understated yet captivating style of piano playing and precise, impeccable musical leadership. He was also helming one of the biggest, most renowned African American jazz groups of the day.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Band's Second Incarnation</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Due to changing fortunes and an altered musical landscape, Basie was forced to scale down the size of his orchestra at the start of the 1950s, but he soon made a comeback and returned to his big-band structure in 1952, recording new hits with vocalist Joe Williams and becoming an international figure. Another milestone came with the 1956 album April in Paris, whose title track contained psyche-you-out endings that became a new band signature.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Collaborations, Awards and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the 1960s and '70s, Basie recorded with luminaries like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/ella-fitzgerald data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ella Fitzgerald" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ella Fitzgerald</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/frank-sinatra data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Frank Sinatra" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/sammy-davis-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sammy Davis Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sammy Davis Jr.</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/jackie-wilson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jackie Wilson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jackie Wilson</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/dizzy-gillespie data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dizzy Gillespie" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dizzy Gillespie</a> and Oscar Peterson. Basie ultimately earned nine Grammy Awards over the course of his career, but he made history when he won his first, in 1958, as the first African American man to receive a Grammy. A few of his songs were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame as well, including "April in Paris" and "Everyday I Have the Blues."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Basie suffered from health issues in his later years, and died from cancer in Hollywood, Florida, on April 26, 1984. He left the world an almost unparalleled legacy of musical greatness, having recorded or been affiliated with dozens upon dozens of albums during his lifetime.</p><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Count Basie</li><li>Birth Year: 1904</li><li>Birth date: August 21, 1904</li><li>Birth State: New Jersey</li><li>Birth City: Red Bank</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: One of jazz music's all-time greats, bandleader-pianist Count Basie was a primary shaper of the big-band sound that characterized mid-20th century popular music.</li><li>Industries</li><li>Astrological Sign: Leo</li><li>Interesting Facts</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>In 1958, Count Basie became the first African-American male recipient of a Grammy Award.</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1984</li><li>Death date: April 26, 1984</li><li>Death State: Florida</li><li>Death City: Hollywood</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=28><ul data-node-id=30 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Count Basie Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/musicians/count-basie</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: April 14, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=33 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Of course, I wanted to play real jazz.

Then, as far as this guy Ellington is concerned, you can never tell what he's going to do. I mean, he'll concert you all, and then he'll swing you all, too, you understand, when he's ready to. He's not limited to anything.</li><li>The Blue Devils was the first big band I ever had a chance to get close to and really listen to, and it was the greatest thing I had ever heard.
