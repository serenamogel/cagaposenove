There are so many new varieties and even different flavors. I mean it when I say it was a real treat to taste all these plant-based bacons so you (and I) can start buying the best vegan breakfast meat out there!</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

I didn’t know you could make a meatless bacon that’s this close to real bacon. Like real bacon, you can cook it to varying degrees of crispiness, which I think is so cool. I like my bacon as crispy as a middle schooler’s hair circa 2005 (we really loved hair gel), while others may like their bacon a little floppier. This bacon gives you options! Also, the flavor is spot-on—it tastes so much like real bacon. My favorite part is that it’s flexible before it’s cooked, unlike many plant-based bacons, so it can be used for jalapeno poppers! Personally, I’ve always wanted to be able to eat bacon-wrapped jalapenos filled with cream cheese, and Ozo Plant-Based Bacon makes that a possibility for me.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best plant-based bacon" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BEST-PLANT-BASED-BACON-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for BLTs</p><strong>Morningstar Farms Veggie Breakfast Bacon Strips</strong><p>I grew up eating Morningstar Farms Veggie Breakfast Bacon Strips and always thought they were delicious. My mom whipped up VBLTs all summer long with these and that sandwich was one of the things I looked forward to the most during the summer months. Before this taste test, however, I was fully prepared for this product to suck. I know sometimes nostalgia primes us to like things that are not actually good. But I was thrilled to find out that it is actually delicious! Even the meat eaters in the office loved it. It’s really crispy, a little smoky, and pleasantly salty. I also totally stand by the fact that this is A+ on a BLT (shout out to my mom).</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best plant-based bacon" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BEST-PLANT-BASED-BACON-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_03.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for Breakfast</p><strong>Ozo Applewood Smoked Plant-Based Bacon</strong><p>This is another incredible offering from Ozo. Their Applewood Smoked Plant-Based Bacon has all the great texture of the jalapeno bacon with an added maple flavor that makes it perfect for breakfast. It’s a little sweet and super smoky. I made a biscuit breakfast sandwich with this, a runny egg, and melted American cheese, and, wow, it was delicious. Don’t get me wrong, though—this doesn’t have to stay confined to mornings. I also made a broccoli salad and crumbled this facon into it for a wonderfully vegetarian version of a porky southern classic.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best plant-based bacon" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BEST-PLANT-BASED-BACON-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_04.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for Breakfast Burritos</p><strong>Sweet Earth Hickory & Sage Benevolent Bacon</strong><p>Let me preface this by saying that this does not taste like bacon—like, at all. It actually tastes like soyrizo, the tofu-based vegan version of chorizo. If you can ignore the fact that this “bacon” is less like vegan bacon and more like spicy, smoky seitan strips, I think you’ll really like it! It’s jam-packed with flavor, and the Mexican flavor profile of chipotle and cumin would be perfection in a breakfast burrito.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other Products We Tried:</strong><br>Be Leaf, Hooray Foods, Upton’s, Lightlife</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Film your own taste test at home and share with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuvMuapa1lkpbAprCMm5icp55k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
