Now it appears Punk’s CFFC co-host poked fun at Tony Khan’s comments about fearing for his life.</p><p>CM Punk and Jack Perry&nbsp;<a href=#>had been suspended following their backstage confrontation</a>&nbsp;at AEW All In, which eventually led to Tony Khan firing CM Punk. Khan would then&nbsp;<a href=#>provide the reason behind Punk’s firing</a>, where Khan stated that he feared for his life because of CM Punk.</p><p>In an exchange between Punk and his co-commentator during CM Punk’s return to CFFC commentary, the co-commentator remarked how a fighter in the arena could be nervous with CM Punk in the room. Punk would then acknowledge what his partner had to say.</p><p>“The bright lights, the big production, I mean, they see CM Punk in the house, they all get nervous, you know what I mean?</p><p>Well they might, I don’t know. For different reasons. Depending on what you’re reading, I don’t know.”</p><p>While the two shared some laughter, the co-commentator decided to poke fun at AEW President Tony Khan’s comments about him fearing for his life at the hands of CM Punk.</p><p>“Some of them fear for their lives, I heard”.</p><p>WWE also doesn’t view signing <a href=#>CM Punk the same level as Cody Rhodes from last year</a>. Eric Bischoff also warned CM Punk that the<a href=#>&nbsp;clock is ticking on his in-ring career</a>. We’ll have to wait and see whether Punk will make his way back&nbsp;to WWE.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What do you think of the CFFC co-commentator making fun of Tony Khan?
