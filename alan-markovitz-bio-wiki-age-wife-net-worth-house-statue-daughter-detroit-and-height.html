The couple together has a daughter named <strong>Tiffany</strong> The couple had married in the year 2012. However, after the 2 years of their relationship, they got divorced as his ex-wife’s Tuophy cheated her husband with another man.</p><p>Alan reacted amusingly. He bought a house right next to his ex-wife and her boyfriend. Alan further lashed out his anger when he spent $7000 to build a <strong>bronze statue</strong> showing a middle finger. The figure was kept in the backyard which directly faced his ex’s house.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alan-markovitz-daughter-tiffany-lenka-and-detroit></span>Alan Markovitz Daughter <strong>Tiffany Lenka and Detroit</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Markovitz is living with his daughter,<strong> Tiffany</strong> from his previous relationship with his ex-wife’s <strong>Lea Tuophy</strong>. Photos of the statue started circulating online when Mrs Tuohy’s daughter <strong>Lenka</strong> tweeted about it.</p><p>“Which is presumably why he bought the house next to hers and erected a $US7000 statue of a hand with its middle finger raised in the backyard bronze statue, which is about 3.5 metres tall, faces the windows of Mr Markovitz’s ex-wife Lea Tuohy’s house.</p><p>“Alan and Tiffany are the best neighbours … but ew who does that lololol #psycho,” Ms Tuohy tweeted.”How psychotic do you have to be to buy the house directly next to your ex-wife and then put a statue up like that?!?! Real classy Alan.”</p><p>Oh, and the guy obviously has enough cash floating around to casually buy a house and chuck a $7000 statue in the yard just to spite his ex-wife and her new partner. Mr Markovitz claims the statue is specifically aimed at Mrs. Tuohy’s housemate, with whom she had an affair while they were married.</p><p>“I’m so over her,” Mr Markovitz told Deadline Detroit. “This is about him. This is about him not being a man.” Mr. Markovitz says a realtor showed him the house next door to Mrs. Luohy’s by coincidence.
