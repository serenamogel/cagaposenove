The physical strain of devoting yourself to the Dark Side warps your body into something monstrous, and trying to dominate the galaxy in a black cloak with a red lightsaber (scary mask optional) paints a big target on your back for any budding Luke Skywalkers out there. On top of that, the Sith “Rule of Two” means there’s always an ambitious apprentice waiting for you to slip up so they can seize the throne for themselves.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>All of which makes it interesting that Darth Sidious dodged those bullets for a very long time (and even after being thrown into a reactor shaft, still managed to mount a comeback).</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>Despite devoting himself to the Dark Side for decades, by the time of Revenge of the Sith, Palpatine still looked like a normal old dude until Mace Windu scarred him.

Like his predecessors, he was so full of himself that he trained his apprentices as “servants”, “tools” or “pawns” and not as “successors”. The only difference was that he was able to maintain his power and thus didn’t need anyone to succeed him to keep the Sith lineage alive. When, in one of the Sequels, he said “I am all of the Sith” I understood it as “I am everything a Sith could ever become” – kind of like “I am the Senate”.</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=90 data-injectable=false>It’s also pointed out that Sidious can effectively decide what the Sith ideology is:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>NerdHistorian’s comment from discussion "Darth Sidious is referred by many as one of, if not the most powerful Sith Lord to have lived.
