By the time the player has defeated Elesa, the player's reinforcements have fended off Team Break.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Battles_13>Battles</span></h3><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Interlude_4:_The_Once-Charming_Prince>Interlude 4: The Once-Charming Prince</span></h2><p>Lear has cornered a Masked Man and Masked Woman at another one of Team Break's hideouts and is ready to battle them with his <a href=# title="Donphan (Pokémon)">Donphan</a>. Before the battle can begin, Rachel and Sawyer arrive to provide backup. Lear refuses to battle alongside them, then proceeds to defeat the thugs by himself, taunting them as they flee. He then notices Cheren approaching them from the distance, leaving Rachel and Sawyer to deal with him despite Sawyer's attempts to get through to him.</p><p>When Rachel asks Cheren why he keeps following them around, he explains that he works as a Gym Leader and teacher in Unova, then expresses concern about Hoopa being in Team Break's possession as well as Lear. Rachel tries to tell Cheren that Lear doesn't need any help, but Sawyer asks him to use his leadership skills to help Lear find his way. Sawyer explains that Lear has grown increasingly obsessed with becoming powerful ever since he lost to the player, worrying that he will get himself into trouble if he takes the throne without knowing what it means to be a true king. Sawyer then convinces Rachel to let Cheren help them get through to Lear.</p><p>Cheren, realizing that Lear's problems ran much deeper than he initially thought, asks them to tell him everything about Lear. It is revealed that Lear used to be a kind boy who loved people and Pokémon, but after the death of his mother, the queen, he was taken out of Rachel and Sawyer's care and sent to a strict school by his father, the king. Once he came back, he only had trust in himself and began to degrade other people and Pokémon. Cheren concludes that the loss of his mother and the two people he relied on the most as well as his experiences he had at school caused him to lose trust in others.</p><p>Sawyer reveals that he was the one who created the rules of the PML in an attempt to help Lear remember how it feels to trust people and Pokémon again, then laments the failures of his plan. Cheren points out that he hasn't known Lear for as long as Rachel and Sawyer have and that he is still a beginner in teaching, but believes that those factors work in his favor. He agrees to do what he can to help Lear become a worthy king. Sawyer is thankful, but Rachel is still skeptical about Cheren. Cheren promises Rachel that he will put all his effort into helping Lear, then asks for clarification about Hoopa's role in regards to Lear and the PML. Sawyer admits that he and Rachel do not understand Hoopa's involvement in the issue, stating that Lear suddenly showed up with it after they decided to create the PML and refused to explain anything about it. Cheren wants to get started on helping Lear as soon as he can, but asks for a favor from Rachel and Sawyer.</p><p>Somewhere else away from Rachel, Sawyer, and Cheren, Lear continues to taunt Team Break, calling them weaklings and insulting their team name. When the three catch up to Lear, he shows them the numerous Team Break thugs he has defeated on his own. He insists that he is better off without teamwork and other people will only hold him back, surprising Rachel and Sawyer. Cheren asks Lear what kind of king he plans to be now that he has gotten so strong. Lear tells Cheren that he will be the strongest king of all, asserting that he will become the Champion of Pasio once he grows even more powerful. Lear tells Rachel and Sawyer to follow him to another Team Break hideout to find Hoopa, but they ignore his orders. Instead, they tell him that they have given up on him and are leaving Pasio, with Sawyer expressing disappointment in his refusal to change.</p><p>After Rachel and Sawyer leave, Lear continues to insist that he never needed them. Cheren then tells Lear that he needs to change.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Chapter_25:_A_Glorious_Gambit>Chapter 25: A Glorious Gambit</span></h2><p>The chapter features a flashback from the formation of the next opposing team. In the flashback, Grimsley's old PML teammates have grown tired of his all-or-nothing battling style. During an altercation, they all decide to leave the team. After they walk off, Grimsley states that they have misunderstood his battling style. Now that he has no teammates, he considers withdrawing from the PML and leaving Pasio. <a href=# title="Will (Masters)">Will</a> and <a href=# title="Karen (Masters)">Karen</a> spot him, then try to convince him to stay on Pasio and join their team. They compliment Grimsley's battling style, then inform him that they are close to qualifying for the PML finals, but need him to join their team in order to do so. Grimsley questions their willingness to let him make risky decisions that could hurt their partner Pokémon. Will's <a href=# title="Xatu (Pokémon)">Xatu</a> and Karen's <a href=# title="Umbreon (Pokémon)">Umbreon</a> are both willing to risk themselves to battle alongside Grimsley. Will asserts that his strength as a member of the <a href=# title="Indigo League">Indigo League</a> Elite Four will guarantee that Grimsley won't need to consider hurting his partner Pokémon to win. Karen also asserts that she will endure whatever it takes to win alongside her favorite Pokémon. Grimsley decides to flip a coin to decide whether or not he will join their team.</p><p>At the PML finals, the player's team is faced against Will and Karen's team. Karen notes that members of the audience were inspired to fight back against Team Break during their battle against Elesa's team during the last round, with Will pointing out that the player's attitude was what motivated the audience to fight. Nanu informs everyone that the stadium's security has been reinforced after Team Break's attempt to sabotage the PML. Will remarks that he had previously heard about Nanu's attitude from someone who he might know. Grimsley arrives in his new sygna suit with his new partner Pokémon, <a href=# title="Sharpedo (Pokémon)">Sharpedo</a>. He states that the designer of the sygna suits was inspired by the more aggressive fighting style he took on to better suit his new team and made him one of his own.</p><p>The player's team wins a battle against Grimsley, Karen, and Will. Grimsley laments that he has nothing left again after having lost to the player. Will agreed with him, but asserts that they will continue to fight until they win regardless of how many times they lose. Karen also insists on Grimsley staying with their team. The team leaves, with Grimsley telling Nanu that his visit to Alola will have to wait. As the player's team is going to check the matchups for the quarterfinals, they run into Cynthia again. She congratulates them on their victory, then reveals that she will be up against their team in the next round, surprising Misty and Brock.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Battle_13>Battle</span></h3><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Interlude_5:_What_Makes_a_King>Interlude 5: What Makes a King</span></h2><p>Rachel and Sawyer watch as Cheren and Lear enter a cave to take on Team Break. Rachel says that Cheren told them to keep their distance from Lear, but she's not sure if it's a good idea. Sawyer says they should trust Cheren's advice, but he's still worried about Lear. Rachel says that she's also worried about Lear, and the two debate over who's more worried about him.</p><p>Inside the cave, Lear expresses his disgust at Cheren continuing to follow him around, but Cheren refuses to leave him alone - especially because Team Break's Pokémon seem to be growing stronger as they go. Lear scoffs that he can handle them on his own no matter how strong they get. Three members of Team Break show up to challenge them, and Lear tells Cheren to stay out of the fight. He struggles to win a bit more than usual, but eventually triumphs over the trio. The leader of the Team Break members blames his two teammates for the loss, claiming that they didn't follow his orders and held him back, and he boasts that next time he'll take on Lear on his own and win.</p><p>After the Team Break members leave, Lear complains that they were pathetic, especially the leader who was "strutting around all high and mighty and couldn't even face up to the fact that he lost". Cheren tells Lear that that's exactly how he looks to everyone else. He also notes that although the Team Break leader blamed the loss on his teammates, they were actually doing a good job of supporting him, and that's why the battle was tougher than Lear expected. In the same way, Lear has been oblivious to how much Rachel and Sawyer have always helped him out against tough opponents, and Cheren wonders if he's finally starting to notice that now. Lear dismisses Cheren's words, claiming that he's gotten to where he is by doing everything himself and he's going to become the strongest king by himself, too. Cheren tells him that if he keeps up that attitude, he'll never be fit to be a king. This ticks off Lear, and he challenges Cheren to a battle so he can crush Cheren completely.</p><p>However, to Lear's shock and dismay, Cheren defeats him. Cheren tells him that the loss wasn't his Pokémon's fault - Lear's Donphan fought very well, but as a lone Pokémon going up against a sync pair, it didn't stand a chance. Then Cheren tells Lear about the two heroes of Unova, who had very different views of the world: one believed firmly in the bonds between Pokémon and people, and the other believed he had to change the world for Pokémon because they were his friends. But both of their beliefs were rooted in caring for people and Pokémon alike, and that allowed them both to be recognized by Legendary Pokémon and grow strong enough to defeat their region's Champion. Cheren says that to be a good king, Lear has to let go of his fixation on being the strongest and learn to care for others.</p><p>Lear considers Cheren's words, and it seems like Cheren might have finally gotten through to him. Unfortunately, they're interrupted by a Team Break leader's voice coming through a speaker. The leader proposes to Lear that they settle this once and for all, and he challenges Lear to come to a certain location alone and battle him. If Lear wins, they'll return Hoopa. Cheren says that it's obviously a trap and they won't fall for it, but the leader taunts Lear by reminding him that as long as Team Break has Hoopa, they can easily ruin the PML, and Lear needs the PML to succeed if he wants to become king. Cheren tries to talk Lear out of it, but Lear ignores him and rushes off to find Team Break, insistent that he won't need to change if he can just become king.</p><h2><span id=Chapter_26:_The_Future_Is_Now.21></span><span class=mw-headline id=Chapter_26:_The_Future_Is_Now!>Chapter 26: The Future Is Now!</span></h2><p>Rosa, Hau, Viola, and the player are discussing their upcoming battle against Cynthia. Hau is excited to battle a Trainer as strong as Cynthia, but Rosa is nervous that they're not strong enough to defeat her. Viola says that they need a plan and suggests that they battle a bunch of strong sync pairs to train their Pokémon and build up their confidence, but Rosa isn't sure how to find a bunch of strong sync pairs in such a short amount of time. Just then, Professor Bellis shows up and asks them what's going on. After Viola explains the situation, Professor Bellis says she knows some people who can help them, and she asks the group to come back to her lab with her.</p><p>Upon arriving at the lab, the group is greeted by Clemont, Sophocles, and Molayne. Molayne introduces himself to the group, and Professor Bellis says they've been helping her with her sync stone research. Clemont activates a machine called the Sync Pair Pinger that he and Sophocles invented; it was designed to detect strong sync pairs and attract them to its location. The Sync Pair Pinger reacts to something outside, and the group goes out to investigate. Three sync pairs have been summoned by the machine, so the player's team battles them.</p><p>However, after defeating the sync pairs, Rosa and Hau say that it was a fun battle, but they were hoping to fight someone stronger. Clemont assures the player that the machine will work right this next time and makes some adjustments to ensure it summons the strongest sync pair in the area. The Sync Pair Pinger activates, but instead of summoning one strong sync pair, it summons a whole mob of sync pairs.</p><p>After the player's team defeats the sync pairs, Rosa and Hau note that they were again much stronger than all of them. Molayne suggests that Sophocles and Clemont inspect the machine to figure out why it's not behaving properly, but Clemont worries that the player's team doesn't have enough time to wait for them to do the inspection. Sophocles insist that the third time's the charm, and they activate the Sync Pair Pinger again.</p><p>Unfortunately, the sync pairs summoned by the machine are once again not terribly strong. Sophocles and Clemont finally admit that the machine was a failure, and they express their regret that they weren't able to help the player's team. But Molayne encourages them, reminding them that it wasn't a complete failure because they were able to make some progress, and he tells them that they'll eventually succeed as long as they don't give up. Just then, Molayne's Dugtrio, Sophocles's Togedemaru, and Clemont's Heliolisk let themselves out of their Poké Balls. Rosa speculates that the Pokémon are responding to the Sync Pair Pinger, making Sophocles and Clemont wonder if the experiment was actually a success. Molayne suggests that they battle the player's team, and Sophocles and Clemont agree to it.</p><p>After the player defeats Molayne, Sophocles, and Clemont, the group returns to Professor Bellis's lab. Molayne admits that he doesn't think the Sync Pair Pinger ever really worked - their Pokémon only let themselves out of their Poké Balls because they really wanted to fight the player. Then, he says that he wants to join the player's team. When Rosa asks why, he says that he thinks the machine failed because it didn't have enough sync pair data, and he can help gather data by battling opponents in the PML. He also says that battling the player made him nostalgic for his island challenge days, and he wants to have more exciting battles like that. The player agrees to let Molayne join the team, and Clemont and Sophocles promise to keep working on the machine until it works properly. Just then, the Sync Pair Pinger goes off again, and the group goes outside to investigate. They find that this time, Blue and his Pidgeot have been summoned and are ready for a battle. While Molayne and Clemont are still unsure if it's the machine's doing, Professor Bellis says that this is the perfect training opportunity, and Rosa accepts Blue's challenge.</p><p>After training with Blue all night, he declares that the player's team is ready for anything. His teammate, Red, comes to pick him up, and Blue says goodbye to the player's team. Rosa is feeling a lot more confident after the training session with Blue, and she says that they have to keep winning so they can have a battle with Red and Blue's team. Meanwhile, at the arena, Cynthia has changed into her sygna suit and is eagerly awaiting the match to see how far the player has come as a Trainer.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Battle_14>Battle</span></h3><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Interlude_6:_Royally_Alone>Interlude 6: Royally Alone</span></h2><p>Rachel and Sawyer are shocked to hear from Cheren that Lear ran off on his own to fight Team Break in order to reclaim Hoopa. The three are about to set off with their Pokémon to find him, when suddenly Team Break Grunts appear and stop them with a battle.</p><p>As Lear waits at a glacier to meet with Team Break, he continues to convince himself that becoming king will solve all of his problems, in spite of Cheren's advice. The Team Break member who spoke to Lear over the speaker arrives at the glacier. Lear prepares to battle him for Hoopa, but it is quickly revealed to be an ambush. Lear attempts to fight off a group of Team Break grunts, but ultimately loses without the help of Rachel and Sawyer.</p><p>After Lear is knocked out by the grunts, he dreams of a memory from years ago. In the memory, a younger Lear heads to the beach by himself in tears. Overwhelmed with the pressure his father puts on him, Lear claims that he doesn't want to be king if it involves this much work. When the cry of a Pokémon can be heard, Lear becomes nervous. Hoopa suddenly appears in front of him, scaring him. Lear shouts at it, saying his family will come running to help him if Hoopa tries to hurt him. However, Lear stops himself and looks down at the ground. Hoopa summons a <a href=# title="Phanpy (Pokémon)">Phanpy</a> to scare Lear, and he yells at it again. To Lear's surprise, Hoopa then summons a beautiful stone to give to him. Lear realizes that Hoopa is not his enemy, and is about to ask it a question before the memory is cut short.</p><p>Lear wakes up in a storage room and realizes that he has been captured by Team Break. He begins to question his own strength, but his thoughts are interrupted when he hears a noise from across the room. Lear turns to see Hoopa, doubled over itself with its eyes shut.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Chapter_27:_The_Quarterfinals>Chapter 27: The Quarterfinals</span></h2><p>Standing at a mountain, <a href=# title="Caitlin (Masters)">Caitlin</a> and <a href=# title="Darach (Masters)">Darach</a> wait for <a href=# title="Cynthia (Masters)">Cynthia</a> to join them. Caitlin yawns out of boredom, and reveals to Darach that she is disappointed in the battles she has had so far in the PML. Darach teases her for having such high standards, but acknowledges that it is only natural after battling with someone like Cynthia. Just as they begin to talk about her, Cynthia appears, revealing that the reason she took so long was because she was changing into her <a href=# title="Sygna suit">sygna suit</a>. She tells the others that she plans to battle with her <a href=# title="Kommo-o (Pokémon)">Kommo-o</a> during her match against the player in the PML, but would like to train first in a practice battle.

Both teams vow to give it their all in their match.</p><p>After the player wins, everyone is frozen in shock. The player's team struggles to comprehend that they were able to defeat a <a href=# title="Pokémon Trainer">Trainer</a> as powerful as Cynthia. Cynthia congratulates them, noting that they are one of four teams left. She tells them that two of the other teams are led by <a href=# title="Red (Masters)">Red</a> and <a href=# title="Lance (Masters)">Lance</a>, but she isn't quite sure who is leading the last one. Rosa attempts to ask a question, but is interrupted by a voice on a speaker.

The team is excited to have a rematch against him, and they leave to prepare for the battle.

They are surprised to run into <a href=# title="Cheren (Masters)">Cheren</a>, who tells Cynthia that he wants to speak to her.

Team Break then arrive unannounced, and disclose to Lear that they plan on using their captured Pokémon to take over the PML—unless Lear announces that he will cancel the PML instead. Lear is resigned to the PML being over, however Hoopa protests against this and musters its remaining strength to teleport Lear away.</p><p>Outside, Lear meets Sawyer, Rachel, and Cheren who help remind Lear of the good times that he had had with Hoopa, and what it makes to be a good king; caring for his kingdom rather than focusing on strength. Reinvigorated, Lear heads back to Team Break's hideout, where Lear, Sawyer, and Rachel team up to defeat Team Break. Team Break's leader arrives to provide reinforcement, but with Lear providing the necessary distraction, Cheren's Stoutland successfully takes Hoopa off Team Break's hands. Lear's sync stone then begins to glow, which had not glowed ever since the first time he had met Hoopa. Lear then teams up with Hoopa as a sync pair to defeat the remainder of the Team Break grunts. Cynthia, who had been enlisted by Cheren, then arrives and reveals that she has already defeated the other Team Break members who had been present at the hideout.</p><p>Later, Lear ponders about the values of friendship, trust, and bond, and thanks Sawyer and Rachel for helping him to grow. Cynthia arrives alongside two Pokémon Trainers who had been Lear's teammates in the PML. Cynthia reveals that these Trainers had not just assisted her in defeating Team Break, but had also won Lear's PML semi-final match despite his absence, advancing their team to the next round.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Battle_16>Battle</span></h3><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Chapter_28:_Change_of_Heart>Chapter 28: Change of Heart</span></h2><p>In the square, Trainers share their predictions for the semifinals. Not wanting to see Lear win, many of them begin rooting for the player. When it is time for the match to begin, Lear doesn't show up, confusing the player's team. As Cheren begins to share some information, a Masked Woman member suddenly appears on the stage to announce that Team Break is coming to wreak havoc. The player's team works to defeat groups of Grunts that come at them.</p><p>As the Team Break Grunts begin to outnumber the player, Lear and Hoopa arrive just in time to defend them, followed by Cynthia. He sends Cynthia to help with security, then continues working with the player. To Lear's surprise, Rachel and Sawyer arrive to help, but he orders them to rest up for the semifinals. Lear leaves to assist Pryce and Iris, scolding them while doing so.</p><p>Lear confronts the last few Team Break Grunts in the stadium. The Masked Woman sends out a <a href=# title="Venusaur (Pokémon)">Venusaur</a> at Lear, but the player and Cheren show up to join the fight. Working together, they defeat the last member of Team Break.</p><p>Lear has Rachel and Sawyer round up every Team Break Grunt they captured and bring them over to him. As the Grunts worry about what lies in store for them, Lear reveals that their punishment is to work for him and help maintain Pasio—something they will even be compensated for. Grateful that Lear is showing them forgiveness, the Grunts remove their Team Break masks.</p><p>Lear announces that the semifinals will be delayed until the next day, as he wants all of the competitors to be able to rest and give it their all during the match. The crowd responds positively, with most people changing their minds about Lear.</p><p>Later that night, as Lear and Hoopa amuse themselves on the beach, Red appears in his sygna suit. Lear admits to Red that one of the reasons he created the PML was to get revenge on him for beating him in a battle when he was previously undefeated. Although Lear had wanted to humiliate Red before, he explains that now he only wants to defeat him.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Battle_17>Battle</span></h3><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Chapter_29:_Semifinal_Showdown>Chapter 29: Semifinal Showdown</span></h2><p>As Lear prepares to leave for the semifinals, Cheren stops by at the villa. Cheren explains to Lear the reason he had been so invested in his growth: Lear reminded Cheren much of his strength-driven younger self. He tells Lear that he wants to pay forward the lessons that he had learned from his Pokémon and other Trainers. Lear does not seem to be receptive to what Cheren has to say, instead hurrying out with his companions and vowing to defeat him and the player at the semifinals. As Lear makes his way to the arena, he is shocked to find that he has a crowd of fans rooting for him. <a href=# title=Paulo>Paulo</a> then happens to walk by, and Lear stops to notice that he has an odd look in his eye.</p><p>The player's team meets with Lear's at the arena. While he first acknowledges that the player is deserving to face him in the finals, Lear declares that he has grown exponentially stronger than them, and that he is going to win. Right before the battle begins, he confesses to Rachel and Sawyer that he is not strong enough on his own, and their only way of beating the player is by working together.</p><p>Lear's team then loses to the player's. Rachel and Sawyer instantly try to apologize for their mistakes, but Lear tells them that they did their best, and that they lost as a team. He admits to the player that he enjoyed their battle, and tells them that the reason he always picked on them was because he was jealous of how much fun they were having in their battles. Lear vows to grow closer with his team so he can defeat the player in the future.

As the player's team makes their return, they are met with crowds of cheering fans, as well as Professor Bellis, who personally congratulates the player. Watching the parade from afar, a group of Team Break Grunts lament being unable to stop the PML. Despite the disbanding of their team, they agree to keep getting into trouble, as that is what they want for their path. Overhearing their conversation, Paulo lingers on the thought of what his own path is.</p><p>Later, Rachel and Sawyer escort the player to the award ceremony. While Lear initially commends the player for their hard work, he suddenly loses his composure. Lear yells at the player, claiming that his father postponed his coronation because of his loss to the player. Determined to become king, Lear announces a second PML.
