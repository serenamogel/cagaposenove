Though the misunderstanding was cleared, Sapphire and Ruby were attacked by a wild <a href=# title="Seviper (Pokémon)">Seviper</a>. Ruby refused to fight as to not risk dirtying his Pokémon, forcing Sapphire to defeat the Tail Snake Pokémon by herself.

Ruby instinctively defeated the Grumpig, accidentally revealing to Sapphire that he wasn't a weak Trainer like she had assumed. Though mad at Ruby for lying to her, Sapphire noted that with Ruby's strength, he could help the Gym Leaders with the upcoming crisis in Hoenn. When Ruby stated he had no interest in helping, Sapphire angrily removed the clothes he made for her, changed into a new leaf outfit, and told Ruby that she never wanted to see him again.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/9/99/Sapphire_second_outfit_Adventures.png/255px-Sapphire_second_outfit_Adventures.png decoding=async width=170 height=402 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Sapphire's second outfit<p>In <i><a href=# title=PS231>Master Class with Masquerain</a></i>, Sapphire challenged Winona to another training session and won, earning the <a href=# title=Badge>Feather Badge</a> in the process.

Afterward, Sapphire and Winona met <a href=# title="Tate and Liza">Tate and Liza</a>'s grandparents, the former guardians of <a href=# title="Mt. Pyre">Mt. Pyre</a>. The elderly couple revealed that fighting Groudon and Kyogre is useless and the best way to stop the conflict is to go to the <a href=# title="Seafloor Cavern">Seafloor Cavern</a> and stop the one controlling them with the <a href=# title="Red Orb">Red</a> and <a href=# title="Blue Orb">Blue Orbs</a>. Due to the Seafloor Cavern being located deep underwater, Sapphire and the others had no way of reaching that location.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS238>The Beginning of the End with Kyogre & Groudon VI</a></i>, Sapphire and Winona were approached by Ruby and Wallace, the former stating he had a change of heart and has decided to help stop the crisis.

Sapphire and Ruby had Chic and <a href=# title=Mumu>Mumu</a> fire their attacks on the Grant Meteor fragment, creating a blast of energy that hit Archie and Maxie where the Blue and Red Orbs were located.

After Zinnia revealed the truth about the meteoroid, the shock of Ruby and the others lying to her caused Sapphire to lose her voice. During the clash, Zinnia managed to steal Sapphire's Mega Bracelet, and Sapphire ended up falling into a ring belonging to the Mythical Pokémon <a href=# title="Hoopa (Pokémon)">Hoopa</a>. Sapphire was transported to the inside of a rocket located at <a href=# title="Mossdeep City">Mossdeep City</a>, where she handed the dimensional shifter to Professor Cozmo and his <a href=# title="Professor Cozmo's assistants">assistants</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS608>Groudon Returns</a></i>, Sapphire met with Steven and Mr. Stone again. While Mr. Stone oversaw the rocket's launch, Sapphire battled against Zinnia in order to prevent from interfering with it. Eventually, Sapphire lost and was sent flying, allowing Zinnia to knock the rocket into the water and destroy the dimensional shifter.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/ab/Ruby_Sapphire_Contest_outfits_Adventures.png/300px-Ruby_Sapphire_Contest_outfits_Adventures.png decoding=async width=200 height=254 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>In <a href=# title=PS612>PS612</a>, Sapphire woke up at <a href=# title="Hoenn Route 120">Route 120</a>, where she landed after Zinnia defeated her. There, she met <a href=# title=Aarune>Aarune</a>, who saw her falling and rescued her. Later, Sapphire spotted Ruby with <a href=# title="Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)">Rayquaza</a> and confronted him about lying to her. After Ruby apologized, Sapphire agreed to help stop the meteoroid and jumped onto Rayquaza's head. To Sapphire's shock, Archie and Maxie also appeared with <a href=# title="Primal Reversion">Primal</a> Kyogre and Groudon. The four then teamed up to destroy a large piece of the meteoroid, combining the power of Hoenn's three super-ancient Pokémon into one attack to shatter it to pieces. After they succeeded, Sapphire used the <a href=# title="Jade Orb">Jade Orb</a> core to peer into Rayquaza's mind, revealing it needed the power of Mega Evolution to defeat the actual meteoroid.</p><p>In <a href=# title=PS615>PS615</a>, Zinnia managed to lure Rayquaza away from Sapphire and Ruby, but her attempt to convince the Sky High Pokémon to join ended with it rejecting and attacking her. Zinnia was rescued by Latios and taken to Sootopolis City to recover from her injuries. Brought to tears, Zinnia gave up and admitted there was no way to save the planet anymore. Emerald disagreed and suggested the three factions that tried to stop the meteoroid work together instead of fighting with each other.</p><p>In <a href=# title=PS616>PS616</a>, the group's allies from around Hoenn gathered together to lend a hand and stop the meteoroid, now known as Grand Meteor Delta. After changing into their <a href=# title="Contest Costume">Contest Costumes</a> and putting <a href=# title="Aqua Suit">Aqua</a> and <a href=# title="Magma Suit">Magma Suits</a> over them, Sapphire and Ruby set off with Rayquaza to space. With the power of Mega Rayquaza and the combined might of their allies from Hoenn, <a href=# title=Kanto>Kanto</a>, and Johto, Sapphire and Ruby successfully shattered Grand Meteor Delta into pieces. A <a href=# title="Deoxys (Adventures)">Deoxys</a> emerged from the wreckage of the meteoroid, but was defeated when Rayquaza shattered its core, knocking it unconscious. Afterward, Rayquaza took Sapphire and Ruby back down to Earth, where they reunited with their friends.</p><p>With the crisis averted, Sapphire and Ruby participated in a <a href=# title="Pokémon Contest">Pokémon Contest Spectacular</a> together.</p><h3><span id=Diamond_.26_Pearl_arc></span><span class=mw-headline id=Diamond_&_Pearl_arc><a href=# title="Diamond & Pearl arc (Adventures)"><i>Diamond & Pearl</i> arc</a></span></h3><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS377>Hurrah for Rapidash</a></i>, Sapphire was mentioned, although not by name, when <a href=# title=Byron>Byron</a> compared <a href=# title="Platinum (Adventures)">Platinum</a> having earned six Badges in 25 days to Sapphire's achievement of earning eight Badges in 80 days.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS408>High-tailing It from Haunter</a></i>, Sapphire was briefly seen together with the other <a href=# title="Pokédex holder">Pokédex holders</a> from <a href=# title=Kanto>Kanto</a>, <a href=# title=Johto>Johto</a>, and <a href=# title=Hoenn>Hoenn</a> when the <a href=# title="Advanced level Grunt">Advanced level Grunt</a> was talking to <a href=# title="Diamond (Adventures)">Diamond</a> about the <a href=# title=Pokédex>Pokédex</a>.</p><h2><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon>Pokémon</span></h2><p>In the original version, Sapphire follows a "one syllable, then another syllable repeated twice" pattern in her nicknames with Chic being the only exception.
