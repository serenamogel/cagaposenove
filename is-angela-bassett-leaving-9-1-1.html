She is all set to return in Season 7 of the show. The rumor about her leaving the show comes from an unverified source.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Imagine this: Your favorite cast from your favorite show is leaving the show while the show has not been finished. Horrible, right? Well, this is what fans of <strong>Angela Bassett</strong> are worried about as there’s a rumor circulating on the Internet that she is leaving 9-1-1.</p><p>Starring the legendary Angela Bassett, <strong>Jennifer Love Hewitt</strong>, and <strong>Peter Krause</strong>, 9-1-1 follows the lives of first responders and dispatchers in Los Angeles. The show highlights the difficult and frequently chaotic scenarios that these first responders confront while dealing with emergencies, rescue missions, and personal challenges. It dives into their high-pressure occupations and the emotional toll it has on their home life.</p><p>Coming back to the subject, is it true that Angela is leaving the show? Or is it just a rumor? Well, here’s your answer.</p><p>Previously, we discussed the&nbsp;<strong>story</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>Rod Stewart</strong>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=angela-bassett-is-not-leaving-9-1-1></span>Angela Bassett Is Not Leaving 9-1-1!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fans are worried if the rumor of <strong>Angela Bassett</strong> (@im.angelabassett)&nbsp;leaving 9-1-1 is true. The 65-year-old actress is the soul of the show and it would be a disaster, both for the creators and the viewers, if she ever decides to leave the show. Fortunately, the rumor is not true; she is not leaving.</p><p>Season 7 of the show has already been renewed and is all set to arrive this year. Along with other major characters, it is confirmed that Angela will return as Athena Grant-Nash. Matter of fact, Angela has never considered leaving the show. There is no such news. We are uncertain how the rumor started.</p><p>9-1-1 will not be the same if Angela ever leaves the show. She has played a vital role in the success of the show. The creators would definitely not want her to leave the show ever.</p><p>According to reports, Angela Bassett makes around<strong> $450,000</strong> per episode on the show. On the other hand, many people might be unaware that she also serves as an executive producer of the show and its spin-off. Hence, there are plenty of reasons why she will not leave the show without any major issues.</p><p>Additionally, we request everyone to not spread news without any strong evidence. Make sure you verify the news from a valid source before you pass it to another person.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=everything-we-know-about-season-7-of-9-1-1></span>Everything We Know About Season 7 of 9-1-1!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Season 7 of 9-1-1 is on the way after surviving FOX cancellation and finding a new home on ABC, and anticipation for the show’s triumphant comeback is already high.</p><p>Months before the show’s debut on ABC, the network released a teaser for 9-1-1 season 7, indicating that the show is already setting up to be its most successful season yet. Though the teaser didn’t show any of the recognizable characters, it did show a terrible explosion on a cruise liner, which will most likely be one of the crew’s biggest emergencies.</p><p>Season 7 of 9-1-1 will be released on March 14, 2024. However, the number of episodes in the new season is unknown. Previous seasons have typically included 18 episodes, though the next season may be cut short due to strike delays (as has been the case with other shows). The FOX cancellation after season 6 and subsequent shift of 9-1-1 to ABC was announced in May 2023, just before the WGA strike began.</p><p>Despite being moved to ABC, the cast and characters of 9-1-1 season 7 will be similar to previous seasons. However, there are a few alterations. Albert Han, played by <strong>John Harlan Kim</strong>, will only appear as a guest in season 7 of 9-1-1, and <strong>Rockmond Dunbar</strong>‘s Michael Grant will not be returning at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYq6vs8SlmGaakajApsDTZqOemaaeu6h5mGZoZmlf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
