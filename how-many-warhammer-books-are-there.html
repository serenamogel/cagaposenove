They are the creator gods of this universe and made all sorts of species to their delight, but the Old Ones were not alone. The Necrontyr are from a hellish planet and they are sworn enemies of the Old Ones. The two sides engaged in battle in what’s known as the War in Heaven.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>The Necrontry are no match for the Old Ones, however, and it took powerful beings known as C’tan to give them living metal armor to defeat them. They become known as the Necron and with this upgrade they defeated the Old Ones, forever changing the afterlife into something else entirely. In response, the Old Ones then create Orcs who fight alongside the Eldar, but it still didn’t go exactly as the Old One had hoped.</p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>The C’tan come to understand that all their devouring would eventually destroy them, and because of an Eldar trickster god, they turn on themselves and eat each other. The Necrons, seeing the ranks of the C’tan drastically decrease, return to their hell planet and wait for life in the galaxy to grow again. Millions of years, humanity is created, but with the Old Gods and the Necrons still around, humanity is not safe.</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=102 data-injectable=false>The number of books seems daunting, but this Warhammer reading order list should help you get started.</p><h2 id=h-horus-heresy data-injectable=false>Horus Heresy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/warhammer.jpg><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>The Horus Heresy by Dan Abnett is the best way to get started with Warhammer. The story takes place in the late 30th Millenium and focuses on the Primarchs, 20 genetically-engineered sons of the Emperor of Mankind. They lead armies of enhanced superhuman soldiers known as the Legiones Astartes and are in a conflict between loyalists and rebel factions. Religion plays a major theme in these stories with the growing Horus Heresy and religious faith overcoming Imperial Truth.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Gotrek & Felix</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Warhammer (@warhammerofficial)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=true>Gotrek & Felix by William King is a must-read for Warhammer fans.
