Since he started acting in the 1960s, Khan has starred in more than 200 Pakistani plays, including well-known serials like “Khaani,” “Ankahi,” and “Meri Shehzadi.” Additionally, he appeared in other Pakistani movies, including “Manto” and “Chan Suraj.”</strong></p><p>For his acting work, Qavi won a plethora of honors and medals, including the renowned Pride of Performance award from the Pakistani government in 1988. In Pakistan’s entertainment business, he was regarded as one of the most seasoned and recognized actors. Sadly, many fans, performers, and business people have sent tributes and condolences to the actor’s family in the wake of his passing on March 5, 2023.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_Naheed_Qavi_the_wife_of_Qavi_Khan>Who Is Naheed Qavi, the wife of Qavi Khan?</span></h2><p>Before his passing, actor Qavi Khan had a balanced personal and professional life. He was a happy guy, and everything in his personal life was going well. The actor and his wife Naheed Qavi were a happy couple. They married in 1968 and remained together until Mr. Khan’s death. Naheed and Qavi were each other’s most important sources of support for over five decades.</p><p>Though little is known about Qavi Khan’s wife, what is known is that Naheed was a very encouraging spouse who always encouraged him to strive for the best in life. Unfortunately, she is devastated and distraught after the loss of her spouse. However, the couple enjoyed a long-lasting marriage until Qavi passed away, and their devotion undoubtedly encouraged many others to think that true love can last a lifetime.</p><h2><span id=The_Family_of_Pakistani-Canadian_Actor_Qavi_Khan_is_Examined>The Family of Pakistani-Canadian Actor Qavi Khan is Examined</span></h2><p>As a young actor in Peshawar, the committed performer started working for Radio Pakistan. Yousefzai Pashtun is the tribe from which Khan’s family hails. His family thereafter moved to Lahore. In 1964, when television broadcasting in Lahore, Pakistan, started, he was one of the original PTV performers and worked for Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV).</p><p>Additionally, the actor and his wife Naheed have two boys and two daughters between them. For his daughters as well as his sons Mehran Qavi and Adnan Qavi, Qavi Khan was a loving and dedicated father.</p><p>The oldest members of the family are his sons Mehran and Adnan. Both of them appeared in drama series on PTV in the late 1990s, but they didn’t continue their professions successfully to take advantage of greater prospects. Both of his boys are now enjoying fulfilling careers in the IT industry.</p><p>Additionally, Mehnaz Qavi, the eldest daughter of Mr. Khan, lives in England with her happily married husband. The information on his youngest daughter is sparse. But the Pakistani star has always been a proud father who nurtured all of his kids with the greatest love, care, and attention. Hopefully, all of his children will put forth a lot of effort to impress their father with their accomplishments.</p><h2><span id=How_Much_Money_Did_Qavi_Khan_Have_Before_He_Died>How Much Money Did Qavi Khan Have Before He Died?</span></h2><p>On March 5, 2023, the famous actor fell away from cancer at the age of 80.
