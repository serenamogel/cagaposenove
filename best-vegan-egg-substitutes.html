Maybe the price of eggs has once again shot up so that all eggs cost as much as farmer’s market eggs, or maybe you’re a vegan looking for a hot, protein-packed breakfast that isn’t oatmeal. Whatever brought you here, know that you’re in good hands. I am an egg lover and, as a mother to a toddler who wakes up at 6 a.m. demanding eggs, an avid egg cooker and eater. I know what eggs taste like. Bragging, sorry.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I know what vegan egg substitutes are trying to taste like. I cooked up some of the top egg alternatives you can buy right now and judged them based on their egg-like flavor and texture. Some were offensive to chickens. But some were so good that I plan on purchasing them should egg prices get out of hand again. Read on for the three best vegan egg alternatives—get ready for a lot of mung bean.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Just Egg Folded Plant Eggs" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_EGG_SUBSTITUTE_INSET_03.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for a Sandwich</p><strong>Just Egg Folded Plant Eggs</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>These refrigerated fake egg blankets are made with mung bean (I told you) as well as something called protein isolate and some dehydrated vegetables. And canola oil. After unfolding one like you’re getting ready to tuck an edible doll into bed, you can microwave it, fry it up in a skillet, warm it in an oven, or even cook it directly in a toaster! In fact, the package recommends the toaster method. Once cooked, it’s extremely fluffy and a little bit stretchy—definitely stretchier than real egg, but maybe that’s egg’s problem. It has a boldly savory flavor that isn’t egg flavor but is still tasty. If you put this on a toasted bagel with some vegan cheese (maybe one of our picks from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best vegan cheese</a> taste test) and a little sriracha sauce, you’d have yourself a real good vegan breakfast sandwich.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Hodo All-Day Egg Scramble" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_EGG_SUBSTITUTE_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for a Bowl</p><strong>Hodo All-Day Egg Scramble</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>If you like tofu scrambles, these are the best vegan scrambled eggs for you. After squelching it out of the bag and onto the plate and warming it in the microwave, it came out quite spongy but very flavorful. Cumin and turmeric are the dominant flavors. I’d happily eat this egg alternative in a hearty breakfast bowl with some beans and sweet potato cubes. But be sure to eat it while it’s still warm. It gets very dense once it gets cold.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Just Egg Plant-Based Scramble" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_EGG_SUBSTITUTE_INSET_01.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Just Egg Plant-Based Scramble</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>This is the best vegan egg substitute for buffet-style eggs. It looks convincingly like eggs—soft and yellow. And it tastes like reconstituted powdered eggs (in a good way). It would be a great vegan egg replacement to use in a breakfast burrito or just on a plate with a side of veggie bacon (the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best veggie bacon</a>, of course). The only give away that this is not powdered egg is the stretch factor. It’s the telltale sign that there’s mung bean in the mix.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other egg alternatives we tried: </strong>Simply Eggless, Vegg Power Scramble</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuwsSgmKdllZy0br%2FUm6qtoaSqwaa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
