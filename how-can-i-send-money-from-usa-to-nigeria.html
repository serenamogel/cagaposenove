In 2021, an estimated $18 billion was the value of remittances coming from the USA into Nigeria, and over $106 billion in the last five years. These remittances account for an immense contribution to the household income of Nigerians. This article explains several avenues to send money from the United States of America to Nigeria.</p><p>These are the various ways to send money from the USA to Nigeria:</p><ul><li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=moneygram></span>MoneyGram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2></li></ul><p>Money can be sent to Nigeria from Nigeria using MoneyGram, either online or in person. To send money online using the MoneyGram website or mobile app is easy to do. Before any transaction can be made, the sender in the USA must create an account with money, which is free and takes a couple of minutes. After successful account creation, using the mobile app or MoneyGram website, the sender should log in to the MoneyGram portal and select a receiver, of which the full details and description of the recipient are required to be provided and also the amount to be sent, and method of receiving payment. The next step entails the sender selecting the desired option to make the payment from, that is, debit card, prepaid card, credit card, or bank account. The confirmation process allows for a review of the information provided and shows the transaction fee to be charged. Then the final step is to send money by clicking the send button. The transaction is completed as fast as possible as the recipient in Nigeria would receive the money in a matter of minutes.</p><ul><li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=worldremit></span>WorldRemit<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2></li></ul><p>WorldRemit is one way to send money from the United States to Nigeria with several options that include Cash pickup, International Bank Transfer, Mobile Wallet, and Airtime Top Up. With thousands of WorldRemit local partner networks around the globe that serve as a hub of payment between the customer and WorldRemit, one can send money to Nigeria from the USA using the Cash pickup option. What is required of the sender to perform the Cash pickup is a means of identification, that is, a Government issued document that is in-date, clear, and readable, and personal details of the sender, the recipient’s full name matching his/her means of identification, the recipient’s account details, that is, account name and account number, as well as the amount to be sent. Through the review process, then payment is the next step to finalize the transaction, of which the accompanying transaction fee, exchange rate and the amount to be collected in Naira, are made known to the sender. Normally, it takes an average of 3 minutes for the recipient to be able to receive the money at a supported location within WorldRemit local partner network. The recipient in Nigeria would be sent a transaction reference via SMS once the payment is made available, which would be used to collect the money, alongside a valid means of identification showing the recipient’s full name supplied in the transaction and photo. Express Union, WafaCash, Credit Populaire, United Bank for Africa (UBA), and Express Exchange have supported Cash pickup partners in Nigeria.</p><p>Then there is the international bank transfer option that can be done from the convenience of any smartphone, tablet, or computer.
