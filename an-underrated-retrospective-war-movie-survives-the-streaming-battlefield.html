Pitsenbarger, an Air Force rescue pilot who saved countless lives in Vietnam by flying in to aid his fellow soldiers on the battlefield, our entry point into the story is Sebastian Stan’s Pentagon staffer Scott Huffman, who is an entirely fictional creation used to drive the film.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>Pitsenbarger was posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross after being killed in battle, but it would take a full 34 years before he was upgraded to full Medal of Honor status, with The Last Full Measure following Huffman’s attempts to have the decorated war hero bestowed with the accolades he deserved for his valor both on the ground and in the sky.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/the-last-full-measure.jpg><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>A 61 percent Rotten Tomatoes score is barely above the Fresh threshold, but it’s the 96 percent user rating that’s worth paying attention to. Jumping between the past and present, the cast is absolutely loaded with talent, with Christopher Plummer, William Hurt, Ed Harris, Samuel L. Jackson, Peter Fonda, Jeremy Irvine, Diane Ladd, and Bradley Whitford just some of the names to appear.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>The Last Full Measure never scored much of a theatrical release, cobbling together a shade over $3 million at the box office on a $28 million budget. However, the underrated and unsung true-life tale has finally found the audience it deserves on streaming, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FlixPatrol </a>revealing it as a new entrant on the platform’s worldwide viewership ranks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKdlpaOxpr7RmquenF2nsrW%2BzqynnpuknsOmedaaqWaln6u2pnnSrqmvoaaawG7Ax55krKyimq6utc2gZJuZpKm5prLInqOdZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
