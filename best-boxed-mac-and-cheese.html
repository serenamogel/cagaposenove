Its creamy and delicious texture is unrivaled; <a href=#>microwaveable</a> and <a href=#>oven-baked macs</a> simply can’t touch it. The little packet of powder (or sauce) that comes with a stovetop mac is basically gold dust (or liquid gold), bursting with richness and flavor. Few foods comfort and satisfy like the best stovetop mac and cheese.</p><p>Over the course of two taste tests, we tried a range of different boxed mac and cheese brands—including the classics, along with some newer additions like vegan boxed mac and cheese and gluten free boxed mac and cheese. These all came with dried pasta, cheese powder or cheese sauce, and the add-ins they advertised. The only things we added were ingredients that were explicitly in the directions, which were only ever milk and butter, if anything.&nbsp;</p><p>There were a lot of dissenting opinions among the Sporked staff about the best box mac and cheese (mainly people were divided on cheese dust vs. cheese goo), but overall we learned that there’s a ton of great boxed mac and cheese for sale, and a few new products that are giving the classics a run for their money. Honestly, it’s hard to go wrong, but if you’re really looking for the best of the best boxed mac and cheese, try one of the picks on this list.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

I like Upton’s for what it is: A vegan boxed mac and cheese that won’t leave you feeling gross afterwards. It’s great if you’re on a plant-based diet or just watching your cholesterol.

Kraft is a titan of boxed mac and cheese brands, and for good reason. And I appreciate that they’re using their platform to add a little health into the well-loved classic. Because if anything can make vegetables palatable, it’s cheese and pasta. While mac and cheese in a box isn’t the first thing most people think about when they seek out a light, healthful meal, I’m a big supporter of the mentality to “eat what you love, add what you need.” If you’re looking to incorporate a little extra veg into your dinner, this is a great way to do it. The cauliflower adds a little complexity to the flavor of the dish, but isn’t overpowering by any means. I found that as it sat, the cauliflower flavor became a little more prevalent, but that honestly wasn’t a deterrent. Is it a dead ringer for the classic that we know and love? Nah. But it’s the best stovetop mac and cheese if you’re feeling lazy and need to dose yourself with veg. — Hebba Gouda</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#ba8da1></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Great Value Artisan Crafted White Cheddar and Black Pepper" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/RANKING-UPDATE_BOXED-MAC-AND-CHEESE_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Big Noodle</strong></p><strong>Great Value Artisan Crafted White Cheddar and Black Pepper</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>I used to be a fan of the classic elbow macaroni. That was back when I was young and naive, and didn’t know that you could have an elbow noodle that’s double the size of a classic elbow but a million times the quality. These beefy elbows are big enough to house a hefty amount of creamy cheese sauce, and curled enough to protect it on the long journey from bowl to mouth, essentially turning each noodle into a twisty water slide of cheese sauce. The ridges on the noodle invite a little extra goodness to cling to the outside, so it’s the perfect shape for a saucy bite through and through. Great Value (yes, <a href=#>Walmart’s Great Value</a>) gets bonus points for having the cheese sauce ready made in a packet with no need to add any additional ingredients, but it does lose on sauce flavor. It’s a little bland and doesn’t follow through on the promise of black pepper, so you’ll have to add your own. Still, thanks to that big ol’ noodle, this is some of the best boxed mac and cheese. — Hebba Gouda</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#ad7e91></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Cracker Barrel Cheddar Havarti Macaroni & Cheese Dinner" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/RANKING-UPDATE_BOXED-MAC-AND-CHEESE_INSET-11.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Cheese Combo</p><strong>Cracker Barrel Cheddar Havarti Macaroni & Cheese Dinner</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>Cracker Barrel is very much like Velveeta Shells & Cheese (#2 on this list). It has the same smooth aesthetic and it’s super salty, creamy, and sharp. It’s a packet-of-goo type of boxed mac and cheese, which I have a strong proclivity towards, but it brings the flavor regardless of where you fall on the stovetop mac spectrum. But it’s the addition of havarti that earns it a spot on our list of the best boxed mac and cheese. It gives it a touch more saltiness and complexity. If you like Velveeta-style but want something with a different flavor, Cracker Barrel Cheddar Havarti won’t disappoint. — Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#bc93aa></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Great Value Original Macaroni & Cheese" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/RANKING-UPDATE_BOXED-MAC-AND-CHEESE_INSET-10.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Budget</p><strong>Great Value Original Macaroni & Cheese</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>What I like about Great Value boxed mac and cheese is their mac and cheese powder to butter and milk ratio. They tell you to add twice as much butter and milk as most other stovetop macs on this list. Great Value understands flavor. The more butter and milk you add, the better your boxed mac and cheese will be. Also, dawg, get this: It costs just 58 cents. Fifty-eight! An amazing budget buy, especially considering this is some of the best boxed mac and cheese. — Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#cf8a9b></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Banza Mac and Cheese Made with Chickpea Pasta" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/RANKING-UPDATE_BOXED-MAC-AND-CHEESE_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Gluten Free</strong></p><strong>Banza Mac and Cheese Made with Chickpea Pasta</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Banza</a><p>Banza is not only the best gluten free boxed mac and cheese we tried, but it also had far and away some of the best sauce of all the brands and flavors we tried. It tastes so much like cheese. I’d love to live in a world where this could go without saying, but so many of the other options were “subtle,” if I’m being kind. They tasted a lot more like butter than cheese, so I was thrilled at the punch of flavor that Banza has. You can really taste the sharpness and intoxicatingly slight whisper of funk from the cheddar, which has enough umami and salt to hold its own without any additional seasoning. The cheese is enough to make up for the lack of noodle integrity, which, because it’s gluten free boxed mac and cheese, ends up a little on the crumbly side. But despite that set back, this was the only box that got finished by the end of the tasting. — Hebba Gouda</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Banza</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#c88b98></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Annie’s Shells & Real Aged Cheddar" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/RANKING-UPDATE_BOXED-MAC-AND-CHEESE_INSET-09.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Cheddar</p><strong>Annie’s Shells & Real Aged Cheddar</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>Personally, I feel that shells are the best pasta for mac and cheese—and Annie’s fills its mac and cheese in a box with perfectly sized little shells. The little cups just hold sauce well. It’s much easier to spoon together a big flavorful serving of shells compared to forking a few tiny elbows. Annie’s also scores big points for being the only mac and cheese on this list that correctly tells you to add salted butter. The other brands either don’t specify or specifically instruct you to add unsalted. That feels wrong. Most mac and cheese lacks proper seasoning if you don’t salt it yourself. While you should probably be salting and peppering all of these yourself, it doesn’t hurt to cut out the middleman and add salted butter. So, for both the choice of pasta shape and the specific butter instructions, this is some of the best box mac and cheese. — Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#bd8598></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Mac ‘N Cheese" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/RANKING-UPDATE_BOXED-MAC-AND-CHEESE_INSET-08.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Spicy</p><strong>Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Mac ‘N Cheese</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Mac ‘N Cheese brings all the wonderful flavor of the Bold & Cheesy (#3 on our list) but with some extra heat. It’s bright red, like the color of an exit sign hanging above a stairwell, but don’t let that deter you. Cheetos makes some of the best boxed mac and cheese because they’ve miraculously been able to distill the flavor of their <a href=#>Flamin’ Hot</a> snack into mac and cheese powder. It’s delectable. They deserve a Nobel prize. Note: Make sure to buy the stovetop Cheetos Mac and not the microwavable one.

Still, there is a delightful buttery, salty, and sweet taste that keeps Kraft macaroni and cheese from the box in our top five. After our initial taste test, editor-in-chief Justine Sterling and I went back in to taste all the macs one more time and we found that Kraft is noticeably sweeter, especially when compared to its competitors. You think it’s just standard, but there’s really nothing quite like it. Plus, there’s something comforting about its simplicity and stability that makes it some of the best boxed mac and cheese.

It’s salty, cheesy, and dense with Cheetos flavor, just like their snacks. The packet of cheese dust that comes with this mac and cheese in a box is absolute gold. This mac is the perfect mash-up of junk food and comfort food. Hell, if a guy like <a href=# rel=noopener>Matty Matheson</a> loves it, then it’s gotta be good. Like all of these mac and cheeses, if you want more flavor in your bowl, you can adjust the cooking ratios accordingly. Personally, I leave a tablespoon or two of pasta out of the package to get a higher ratio of dust-to-pasta. Cheetos Bold & Cheesy carries intense flavor.

Personally, it’s my favorite. As <a href=#>previously stated</a>, Velveeta adheres to the Italian principles of pasta very well. It is creamy, smooth, buttery, delicious, and somehow every molecule of shell feels drenched in thick, delicious cheese goo. In this way it’s like cacio e pepe. The texture of Velveeta Shells & Cheese is very much like the mac and cheese I make from scratch. Sure, it’s overly processed cheese goo, but it’s America’s overly processed cheese goo. And you can’t debate the gloriously smooth and velvety texture.
