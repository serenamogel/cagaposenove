To put it plainly, the best ranch should be able to do anything and everything.</p><p>“What is a ranch anyway?” Sporked contributor Danny Palumbo asked halfway through our ranch dressing taste test. It’s a legitimate question. To me, ranch has always been creamy, herby, and thick (but not too thick). A good ranch should strike the perfect balance of sweetness, tartness, and saltiness. What we found, however, is that there are many different interpretations of ranch dressing that range from incredibly delicious to truly heinous. We weren’t wasting time with baby carrots, either. For this taste test—we’ve done two, in fact—we just ate big spoonfuls of salad dressing to find out which ranch is the ranchiest ranch on the market. Here are the best ranch dressings you can buy right now:</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_RANCH-UPDATE_INSET-08.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Dairy-Free</p><strong>Follow Your Heart High Omega Vegan Ranch Dressing</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>If you don’t eat dairy, grab a bottle of this Follow Your Heart High Omega Vegan Ranch Dressing. It’s creamy, rich, and garlicky. It doesn’t have any weird twang of artificial flavor like some of the other vegan (or even regular) ranch dressings we tried. I don’t necessarily think this ranch dressing will turn you into a vegan, but I think it’s a great option if you stick to a plant-based diet or are looking to cut down on animal products in general. That’s why it’s one of the best ranch dressing brands (definitely the best vegan ranch dressing) we tried in our taste test.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_RANCH-UPDATE_INSET-07.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Fan Favorite</p><strong>Marzetti Simply Dressed Ranch Dressing</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>Everyone screamed at us when we first published our best ranch dressing ranking.

For some reason, I assumed there would just be an essence of parm, as if it had been finely grated and then disintegrated into the dressing as it sat on the shelf. I was thrilled to be wrong! Another exciting feature of this dressing is that it tastes like ranch mixed with the beloved Olive Garden Italian dressing. If you’ve ever thought, “Hmm, I wish Olive Garden Italian dressing was way creamier,” your prayers have been answered!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Ryan Martin / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BEST-RANCH-DRESSING-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Almost Homemade</strong></p><strong>Tessemae’s Gluten Free Classic Ranch Salad Dressings and Dip</strong><p>I’m glad I tried this ranch during our taste test because I would normally never buy a product boasting the fact that it’s “Whole30 Approved” and “Keto Friendly.” It loses sporks for its fitness-forward advertising but wins sporks in every other category. My favorite aspect of Tessemae’s Classic Ranch is its sensational herbiness. There are so many herbs packed into the bottle that the dressing is not a white color like most other ranches on the market. Please ignore the packaging and give this ranch a try.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Ryan Martin / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_RANCH-UPDATE_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Flavored</p><strong>Market Pantry Spicy Chipotle Ranch Dressing</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>Market Pantry Spicy Chipotle Ranch from Target doesn’t really taste like the ranch we know and love.

This would be sensational on a taco salad (or even poured on top of tacos, to be honest). If you like ranch but want even more zest, this is an excellent option.

If you gave this to me in a ramekin at a restaurant, I’d think it was made in-house. It tastes so good I’d probably just drink it from the bottle if I didn’t think all that dairy would make me violently ill.

It is one of the best ranch dressing brands on the market. Yes, of course, there are brands that make fancier or more homemade-style ranch dressings, but Hidden Valley isn’t trying to be fancy or homemade. They are trying to make the best store-bought ranch and have it be affordable. They are succeeding. What makes this ranch stand out is that it’s perfectly balanced: It’s a little herby, a little sweet, and a little tangy. You can’t pick out any one ingredient because everything is so beautifully homogeneous. This ranch would be good on anything, but I think the viscous texture and squeezable bottle make it ideal for squirting onto pizza (the most important use for ranch). This is unrelated, but did you know that there is an actual Hidden Valley Ranch in Santa Barbara? Did you also know that I am desperate to go there?</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Ryan Martin / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_RANCH-UPDATE_INSET-10.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Marie’s Creamy Ranch Dressing + Dip</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Ralphs</a><p>We’d like to thank Daniel, Sporked reader, for opening our eyes to the wonders of Marie’s Creamy Ranch. His persistence in the comment section after we initially published our ranking of the best ranch dressing made us buy a bottle of this stuff, and it is now our favorite store bought ranch dressing. It is thick, creamy, and herby. There’s absolutely zero weird chemical-y aftertaste or strange, unnecessary twang. It’s thick enough for wings but thin enough to dress a salad. Marie’s Creamy Ranch is totally perfect.
