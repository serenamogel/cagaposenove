Whether it’s spicy foods, oil therapy, or acupuncture, some parents-to-be will try anything. This viral <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>TikTok</strong></a> seems to have found a new method of inducing labor.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>Mom-to-be Shailene Alexus was enjoying a day of pickleball and went in for a jump to make an impressive hit. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately?), that jump resulted in a well-placed shot and her water breaking causing her to let out a yell and halt the pickleball match.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true><a title=@shailenealexus href=#>@shailenealexus</a><p>Pickleball did it! <a title=waterbroke href=#>#waterbroke</a> <a title=pregnancy href=#>#pregnancy</a> <a title=pickleball href=#>#pickleball</a> <a title=9months href=#>#9months</a> <a title=38weeks href=#>#38weeks</a> <a title=jumpman href=#>#jumpman</a> <a title=activepregnancy href=#>#activepregnancy</a></p><a title="♬ Oh No (Instrumental) - Kreepa" href=#>♬ Oh No (Instrumental) – Kreepa</a></figure><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Overdue moms in the comment section are already prepared to try this tactic to speed up their own labor process. Other commenters were just impressed at Shailene’s pickleball skills while nine months pregnant, saying that jumping that much while pregnant had much worse ramifications for them. A few speculated that maybe the water breaking was actually just a bladder leak from the impact of the jump. “Or you peed a little, both reasonable,” posted one viewer.</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>This theory was later confirmed by Shailene when she posted a video saying she was still pregnant and at home a day later. She said she was 38 weeks pregnant and only growing, despite the hopeful water-breaking incident.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true><a title=@shailenealexus href=#>@shailenealexus</a><p>Baby boy is comfy in there. <a title=bumpdate href=#>#bumpdate</a> <a title=38weekspregnant href=#>#38weekspregnant</a> <a title=poolday href=#>#poolday</a> <a title=heatwave href=#>#heatwave</a> <a title=pregnant href=#>#pregnant</a> <a title=bigbelly href=#>#bigbelly</a> <a title=update href=#>#update</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Righteous Babe" href=#>♬ original sound – Righteous Babe</a></figure><p data-characters=779 data-current-count=779 data-injectable=true>Mistaking a bladder leak at the start of labor can be an easy thing to do, especially if you’ve never been pregnant before. According to the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Mayo Clinic</a>, in some cases, it is best to check with a healthcare provider if you’re not sure of the difference. The “water breaking” isn’t water, but actually fluid from the membrane sac that surrounds the baby in the uterus. To determine if the leakage is actually amniotic fluid or if it is just urine, a doctor can do a physical exam or an ultrasound to check the levels of amniotic fluid left in the womb. For cases like Shailene’s, it is important to learn the difference when it happens, because once the water breaks that typically means that labor is about to begin if it hasn’t already.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>As it turns out, the pickleball craze that’s sweeping the nation may not be good for any more than social time and exercise. Although, who knows, maybe the next viral TikTok video really will be a broken water and not just a leaking bladder. For all that she went through with her viral pickleball shot, here’s hoping that Shailene won at the very least.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLHLpWSgmZ2aerDCxKtkqaqVnLuiutNmrqilkaPAbsPArZyrZZKnsqK30mabrqqZo7Ruvs6uqqKml2KvsMHTZqafZaCesKy4xGaZmqScZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
