Despite the series’ relatively short run from 2001 until 2004, it became an instant classic and changed the life trajectory of a generation of young kids.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Okay, that last part might be an exaggeration, but for those of us who grew up with Lizzie Mcguire, she was an icon. The show’s success spawned The Lizzie McGuire Movie, which in turn gave us the awesome “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sing for me, Paolo</a>,” and we will always appreciate the coming-of-age show for launching <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hilary Duff</a></strong>’s career.</p><p data-characters=716 data-current-count=1046 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately for all of Lizzie’s fans, it’s unlikely we’ll see a continuation in the style of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">iCarly</a> anytime soon. A planned sequel series starring Lizzie and the gang as adults was announced by Disney Plus in August 2019, but any excitement we felt was short-lived. After showrunner and creator Terri Minsky left the project in early 2020, the series fell apart in pre-production. Duff complained on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> about not being able to give a realistic portrayal “of a 30-year-old’s journey to live under the ceiling of a PG rating.” Despite hoping the reboot could move over to the more adult-friendly Hulu, it was ultimately shelved. At least we got a virtual table read, which was nostalgic in itself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>Maybe a new show isn’t in the works.
