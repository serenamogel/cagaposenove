Now, the Oscar-winning screenwriters and longtime friends may be returning to the big screen as co-stars – that is, if Harvey Weinstein has his way.</p><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=877 data-injectable=true>The Weinstein Company recently bought the film rights to a recent New York Times Magazine cover story titled&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>A Speck in the Sea</a></strong>, by Paul Tough. The article tells the incredible true story of two lobster fishermen, John Aldridge and Anthony Sosinski. Aldridge fell into the ocean in the middle of the night without a vest, while Sosinski woke up hours later to find his lifelong friend awash at sea. The frantic life-and-death situation eventually required the Coast Guard and other rescue operations to bring Aldridge to safety.</p><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>This powerful true story has the potential to be a thrilling and devastating drama, more along the lines of All is Lost than Captain Phillips. According to Page Six, Weinstein is considering Damon and Affleck to take on the roles of Aldridge and Sosinski, respectively. With their fame, friendship and connection to the Northeast, Ben and Matt seem like two of the most obvious choices for the drama. Although there is no writer attached to A Speck in the Sea, it would definitely be cool to see the duo tackle another script together.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>Admittedly, the film does sound similar to the minimalist survival drama Gerry, a project that Damon made with Affleck’s older brother, Casey, for director Gus Van Sant in 2002. If Ben is too busy with his superhero agenda later this year, Casey could be a worthwhile substitute. Damon, meanwhile, has no major projects on the horizon, and should be able to take the role.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=false>We’ll definitely keep you posted when we hear more but for now, tell us, do you want to see Affleck and Damon star in&nbsp;<strong>A Speck In The</strong><strong> Sea</strong>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomZ6mXZazp7jEnKJmpZGpwW6wwKamp2WimsKvtdOeZJplo6WypLeMoqVmrJiaerSxwGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
