It was really sad,” Katakis said.</p><p>“To me, he was my mentor.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Andrew Bellucci’s Pizzeria confirmed the chef’s death on Thursday. <span class=credit>Instagram/Andrew Bellucci</span></figure><p>The Astoria pie joint said it would be closed Thursday in the late owner’s honor.</p><p>As a chef and a businessman, Bellucci was <a href=#>known for taking the adage of getting one’s hands dirty a little too far</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Bellucci opened his eponymous pizza joint after a spat with his former business partner. <span class=credit>Stephen Yang</span></figure><p>After making a name for himself by revamping Lombardi’s on Spring Street in Manhattan in the early ’90s, his career was interrupted by a stint behind bars for embezzling funds from a law firm where he previously worked.</p><p>Bellucci then spent 16 years driving cabs before getting back into the slice game by sojourning to Kuala Lumpur with restaurateur Michael Helfman in 2013.</p><p>He opened Bellucci Pizza on 30th Avenue with Leo Dakmak in 2021.</p><p>One of the specialty pies, the pepperoni-loaded “Sonny Supreme,” was named in honor of his former cellmate, Colombo underboss John “Sonny” Franzese.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have only one goal,” he told The Post at the time.</p><p>&nbsp;“And it’s to become the first slice shop with a Michelin star.”&nbsp;</p><p>Bellucci and Dakmak’s partnership was short-lived.</p><p>Within months, Bellucci <a href=#>broke away entirely</a> and opened rival Bellucci’s Pizzeria just eight blocks away after joining forces with Katakis.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Bellucci spent time in prison for embezzlement. <span class=credit>Stephen Yang</span></figure><p>He changed the name of the new restaurant to Andrew Bellucci’s Pizzeria last summer as part of a settlement when <a href=#>Dakmak reportedly sued him for trademark infringement</a>.</p><p>“We were finally at the point where we felt streamlined, ready, operating correctly and had everything working. And now, this is a tremendously tragic event. But we learned from him,” said Katakis, who gave Bellucci the “Don of Dough” nickname.</p><p>“He was a great teacher and philosopher of the dough,” he added</p><p>“That’s who he was. There was no better crusts in my opinion in New York City.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29maWlfmbyvec6fZJ2npZy1brrYnGSpoaqvrm64xKCcp5xdlrulvsSwZJudnKHCpK%2FIZpuemZRirrV5lHJm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
