MC Maneirinho desires a connection free from fear or pretense. He questions his partner’s aloofness and asserts that she is playing games, which makes him perceive her as dominant and demanding.

The lyrics express a desire to spend time together, particularly in the “hidromassagem.” The artist acknowledges the flaws and challenges in their bond, mentioning being lost.
