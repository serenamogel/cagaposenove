Although the player had a decent game, the Broncos were clear in their ideas to use Joe for headcount and reach the 80-player limit on the ET deadline on Tuesday, reports&nbsp;NBC Sports.</p><p>After the deadline, the team waived the athlete, now a free agent. It is his second release in one year since the&nbsp;Pittsburgh Steelers&nbsp;released him after a season in March 2022. Amid the news of his unsuccessful stay with the franchise teams recently, many people have taken an interest in his personal life and pondered his wealth.</p><p>Thus, here is what we found about his net worth and other details.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-joe-schobert-net-worth-in-2022></span>What Is Joe Schobert Net Worth In 2022?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joe Schobertâ€™s net worth in 2022 is estimated to be over $10 million, despite missing official verification.</p><p>Schobert signed a massive five-year contract worth $53.75 million with the Jacksonville Jaguars when he joined the team in 2020. Along with the base salary, the athlete also received a guaranteed $21.5 million on top of the $12 million signing bonus. This deal generated an annual salary of around $10.75 million. He spent one year with the Jaguars before moving on to the Pittsburgh Steelers in a trade.</p><p>In the 2021 season, Joe made around $7 million in wages, without including any additional bonuses, reports&nbsp;NBC Sports. The Jaguars paid half of it while the Steelers compensated the other half.</p><p>Even before signing a contract with the Jaguars, Joe was under a four-year deal with the Cleveland Browns, a $2.97 million deal with a signing bonus of $634,000. Based on these numbers, it seems clear that the athlete is a multi-millionaire with at least around $10 million in accumulated wealth.</p><p>Nonetheless, the detailed verification of his&nbsp;net worth&nbsp;remains pending since the top sites have not revealed his fortune.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-schobert-wife-megan-mcdonnell-and-children-details></span>Joe Schobert Wife Megan McDonnell And Children Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joe Schobert tied the knot with his wife, Megan McDonnell, in July 2018, and they have been together for over four years.</p><p>The couple dated for a long time before the linebacker eventually proposed to the lady in March 2017 in front of the Eiffel Tower. Megan said yes, and they got engaged. Around a year later, they tied the knot and completed their long-term union.</p><p>Schobert and his spouse, McDonnell, have a son named Simon West Schobert, who appears to be around two years old. While Joe is a recognized&nbsp;football player, Megan is a dancer and TikTok personality with over 400k followers. She runs her dance center under the name Schotime Dance Center.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-schobert-age-and-wiki></span>Joe Schobert Age And Wiki<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The American football linebacker, Joe Schobert, is 28 years old.</p><p>He was born on November 6, 1993, in Waukesha, Wisconsin, United States.
