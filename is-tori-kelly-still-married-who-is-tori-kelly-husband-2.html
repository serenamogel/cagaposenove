The couple’s relationship is based on mutual faith and trust in each other. Murillo may have retired from basketball, but he continues to inspire people with his story of resilience, determination and faith. Murillo’s basketball journey began in high school when he attended El Toro High in Lake Forest, California. He later played college basketball at Concordia University, but was kicked out due to disciplinary issues. After being kicked out, Murillo went on to play basketball at Biola University until his graduation. In 2019, Murillo announced his retirement from basketball after suffering an injury that left him unable to play. However, his path is not only marked by basketball successes. At one point in his life, Murillo was critically injured when he was stabbed at a party. After being released from the hospital, he began using drugs to relieve pain, which eventually led to addiction. In that moment, he turned his life around. Murillo found solace in his faith and turned to God to help him overcome his addiction. He enrolled at Biola University, where he was able to rebuild his life and rediscover his love for basketball. Dave Holmquist, Murillo’s basketball coach at Biola University, played a key role in helping Murillo turn his life around.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CebZah-FWo3/</p><h2><span id=Tori_Kellyrsquos_Instagram>Tori Kelly’s Instagram</span></h2><p>Victoria Loren Kelly, born December 14, 1992, is an American singer-songwriter and actress who rose to fame by sharing videos on YouTube as a teenager and competing on the ninth season of American Idol in 2010, making it to Hollywood Week.
