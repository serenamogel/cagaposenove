As a matter of fact, Colletti's chemistry with Steve Martin is so infectious that it quickly becomes obvious why Charles found it so difficult to come to terms with Lucy's absence from his life for so many years.</p><p>Of course, it doesn't hurt that, despite her young age, Colletti has already built an impressive screen career for herself. Indeed, in the years since she made her 2006 screen debut, Colletti has appeared in nearly 20 TV shows and movies (via <a href=#>IMDb</a>). In 2018, for instance, she appeared as Ruth-Ann in the acclaimed drama "Wildlife," and she played Stella Nicholls a year later in the 2019 horror film, "Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark." Meanwhile, on the small screen, Colletti has had recurring roles on "City on a Hill," "Fear the Walking Dead," and the recent Netflix original series, "Boo, B****."</p><p>As of now, it's unclear just how much of a presence Colletti's Lucy will have in "Only Murders in the Building" Season 2. It seems safe to assume that Lucy will play some kind of a role in the show's latest murder investigation, but it's impossible to say what that will ultimately be. However, in a June interview with <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>, Steve Martin did warn viewers that they should "be suspicious of everyone, because the show is. Every time a new character comes on, we're very suspicious of that character."</p><p>Here's to hoping, for Charles' sake, that Lucy's hands are totally clean when it comes to the murder of Bunny Folger (Jayne Houdyshell).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvOqZyrZpOkunCFkmlobnBfrLWwec%2BlmLKrXaHCpMWMoqVmp56hxm651KubnqqjYravedOhnGaapZ65pbXNoGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
