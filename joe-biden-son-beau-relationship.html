Many times, one or both boys could be found scampering on the train seats beside "Amtrak Joe" as he made his regular trips to the nation's capital.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The devotion to family life helped all three recover from the life-altering loss and forge an unusually tight bond. A few years later, after teacher <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/jill-biden data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jill Jacobs" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Jill Jacobs</a> had become a beloved addition to the group, Beau and Hunter helpfully informed their father that "we think we should marry Jill."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By the time the boys were teenagers at Archmere Academy, Beau was showing signs of following in the elder Biden's footsteps. A natural leader, he was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="known as" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">known as</a> "The Sheriff" among friends and was elected student-body president.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After attending Syracuse Law School, his father's alma mater, Beau began carving out his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://veterans.syr.edu/news/notable-veteran-alumni-joseph-beau-biden-iii/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="own path" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">own path</a> as a public servant. He spent five years as a federal prosecutor in Philadelphia, before winning election to the Delaware Attorney General's office in 2006. He also joined the Delaware National Guard in 2003, eventually rising to the rank of major.</p><img alt="Joe Biden with his son, U.S. Army Capt.

Beau Biden, at Camp Victory on the outskirts of Baghdad on July 4, 2009</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Beau became a vital campaign surrogate for Joe</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beau also developed into an invaluable campaign presence for the elder Biden. Shortly before being deployed to Iraq with his unit in 2008, Beau made a splash at the Democratic National Convention with a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.politico.com/story/2008/08/transcript-beau-biden-012913 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=speech class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">speech</a> that shined a light on his father's impressive efforts as a single parent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Four years later, Beau delivered another rousing <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2012-democratic-national-convention-remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-beau-biden-attorney-general-of-delaware-and-son-of-vice-president-joe-biden-168866286.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=introduction class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">introduction</a> at the Democratic Convention that concluded with him citing his dad as "my hero" and dramatically calling for a vote by acclamation to re-nominate him for VP.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Beau had a way of instilling courage and calming me," Joe wrote in his 2017 memoir, Promise Me, Dad, noting how his elder son was usually the last person in the room with him before important campaign events.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Beau would always grab my arm just before I walked onstage and pull me back toward him until I was looking into his eyes. 'Dad. Look at me. Look at me, Dad. Remember, Dad. Home base, Dad. Home base.'"</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Beau was diagnosed with aggressive brain cancer in 2013</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By 2010, however, the Biden family was already headed for another trial. Beau suffered a stroke that year, and while he was given a clean bill of health in the aftermath, he began suffering from aphasia, a condition in which he had trouble remembering proper nouns.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2013, the situation became more dire when Beau was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive brain cancer. He opted for an experimental treatment and attempted to carry on business as usual, even announcing in spring 2014 that he planned to run for Delaware governor in 2016.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Behind the scenes, the rest of the family watched with concern as Beau grew weaker. In fall 2014, Joe wrote in his later memoir, he was jolted when his son said he was "going to be OK no matter what happens," seemingly acknowledging that he was fighting a losing battle, before adding, "You've got to promise me, Dad, that no matter what happens, you're going to be all right. Give me your word, Dad, that you're going to be all right. Promise me, Dad."</p><img alt="Beau Biden welcomes his dad, Joe Biden, at the Pepsi Center during the third day of the Democratic National Convention on August 27, 2008, in Denver, Colorado" title="Beau Biden welcomes his dad, Joe Biden, at the Pepsi Center during the third day of the Democratic National Convention on August 27, 2008, in Denver, Colorado" width=4256 height=2832 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/joe-and-beau-biden-gettyimages-161090429.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Photo: Joe Amon/The Denver Post via Getty Images</span><p>Beau Biden welcomes his dad, Joe Biden, at the Pepsi Center during the third day of the Democratic National Convention on August 27, 2008, in Denver, Colorado</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Joe was torn by the decision to run for president following Beau's death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By early 2015, the pressure was on for Joe to announce whether he intended to run for president in 2016. While noncommittal in public, the VP was already leaning toward the affirmative, his family viewing the endeavor as something to give them a common purpose and, hopefully, carry them through to happier days ahead.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But that dream began falling apart as Beau's condition took a turn for the worse in April. The brief recoveries turned out to be illusions, and 46-year-old Beau took his final breath at Maryland's Walter Reed Medical Center on May 30, 2015.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Beau measured himself as a husband, father, son and brother. His absolute honor made him a role model for our family," the heartbroken father said in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/05/30/vice-president-bidens-family-announces-death-of-his-son-beau-biden/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=statement class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">statement</a> shortly afterward. "In the words of the Biden family: Beau Biden was, quite simply, the finest man any of us have ever known."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The second major tragedy of his life presented something of a Catch 22 to Joe, who was too distraught to pursue the Oval Office but also worried about betraying his son's wishes by throwing in the towel. It wasn't until late October that he formally acknowledged the futility of undertaking a presidential campaign while still grieving.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Joe continues to draw inspiration from his eldest son</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the epilogue to Promise Me, Dad, Biden wrote that he came to understand that, more than anything else, Beau wanted him to remain engaged in public service.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, that engagement led right back to the campaign trail with Joe's announcement that he was running for president in 2020 and his rise to the top of the Democratic field.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And while his matchup against Republican incumbent <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Donald Trump</a> occupied the minds of most voters, Joe relayed how much he was still thinking about his eldest son to the media, including an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/joe-biden-breaks-down-tears-beau-should-be-one-running-n1120211 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="emotional appearance" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">emotional appearance</a> on Morning Joe in January 2020.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Beau should be the one running for president, not me," he told host Joe Scarborough.
